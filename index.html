<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="me.jpg">
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>I dont know if this will work. My name is Paul Bryant-Smith, student number s3871668, student email address s3871668@student.rmit.edu.au. I am originally from Rye on the Mornington Peninsula down in Victoria. I moved up to Sydney about 13 years ago for my job in the Navy. I am an electronics technician specializing in Air Search Radars.</p>
<h3>Interest In</h3>
<p>I am interested in creating and tinkering with a wide variety if IT related products and software. I have always been interested in IT. I remember sneaking out of my room at a young age to play the original Doom in the early hours of the morning.

My Father has always been an inspiration in the IT world for me. One of the first experiences I remember was my dad would modify nibbles in Q basic to change the speed of the game to make it easier for us to play.

My IT experience is limited to mainly the training and courses my work has offered including the programming modules that were part of my Diploma in Electronics and Communication engineering.

I chose RMIT because it has a good reputation in the IT industry and was recommended to me from one of my work colleagues. I expect to gain a better understanding in the industry and hopefully work out what exact direction I would like to move my career into.
